What?
-----

You can compare two image files and it will show a difference score between 0 and 1.
Using transparent reference PNG images, you can also skip certain areas of the file.

Why?
----

We take screenshots of running live systems and check whether they are (visually) in a certain state.

Who?
----

Especially software developers testing software might find this software useful.
Consider that Mozilla Firefox's just got a link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Headless_mode[headless mode] and soon you will be able to take screenshots.
